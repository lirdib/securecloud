## use our build virtualenviroment

#### Attention: to make this work, we recommend on Windows to use Git Bash as terminal!!

1. open the terminal in the directory, where also the `README.md` ist stored (main directory)
2. on Windows type `python -m venv env` in the terminal | on MacOS/Linux type in your terminal `python3 -venv env`
3. on Windows (Git Bash) and MacOS type in your terminal `source env/Scripts/activate`
4. at the activated virtualenviroment `env`, type `pip install --upgrade pip` in the terminal
5. then enter the command `pip installl -r requirements.txt`
6. Now you can select in the open folder in VS Code the virtual-enviroment `env` as python-interpreter
